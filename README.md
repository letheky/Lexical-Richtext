# React + Vite + Lexical

This is a repo using Lexical for super customizable rich text editor 

## Getting Started

First, install all dependencies:

```bash
bun install 

```
but if you didn't have bun yet, you should install it with the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash    # for macOS, Linux and WSL 
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1|iex"  # for Windows

```

Then you can run the development server:

```bash
bun dev 

```

Happy coding !
